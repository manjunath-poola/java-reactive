Reactive :
   reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.
   With this paradigm, it's possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease,
   and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the
   automatic propagation of the changed data flow.

Use cases :
  1. User events :
           a. example working on UI, when user clicks on a button you want to do something. You are reacting to the button clicks
           b. When I/O response happens when file read completes or writes complete

Server Side web development
Steps :  a. request comes b. do processing 3. return response

Why Backend developers need to care reactive
  a. High data scale
  b. High usage scale
  c. Cloud based costs  // bad code makes you charge more on cloud

How to scale up
    a. Vertical scaling
    b. Horizontal scaling

Code Example :
  we have method like
  @GetMapping(/user/{userId})
  public User getUserDetails(@PathVariable String userId){
    User user = userService.getUser(userId).
    UserPreference userPreference = UserPreferenceService.getUserPreference(userId).
    user.setUserPreference(userPreference);
    return user;
  }
Note : when we see below two lines, both does call 2 different services and get the results and combine returning to the User
    User user userService.getUser(userId).
    UserPreference userPreference UserPreferenceService.getUserPreference(userId).

Issue : both above are blocking calls., these 2 are unnecessarily sequential calls.

Cost:
 Performance

1. WebApplication for each request one Thread will be created for processing..

request   --->   Thread ---->
request   --->   Thread ---->
request   --->   Thread ---->
  |                 |
request   --->   Thread ---->

2. Idling Threads for I/O or netweork calls

Cost
Wasted hardware

Spoilt backend developers

With SpringMVC we code like
    1. It's a single request.
    2. Multiple simultaneous users abstracted out
    3. Delays abstracted out
    4. we pay with sequential blocking operations
    5. we pay with idling threads

But wait, we have concurrency API's tp achieve the parallel programming. Since Java-8
 Example : CompletableFuture<User> userAsync = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->userService.getUser(userId));
 Implements 'Future' and goes behind it
 Works with 'CompletionStage' to co-ordinate async operations.

    a. Call UserService
    b. call userProfileService in Parallel
    c. when both return, merge the data structures
    d. Return merged object

Code:
  CompletableFuture<User> userAsync = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->userService.getUser(userId));
  CompletableFuture<User> userProfileAsync = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(()->userProfileService.getUserProfile(userId));
  CompletableFuture<User> bothFutureAsync = CompletableFuture.allOf(userAsync,userProfileAsync);
  bothFutureAsync.join(); // join from CompletableFuture, it is still blocking.

Issues with above
1.Too much for the dev to do
2.Error handling is messy
3.It's still sync after all
4.we need a new Paradigm
5.The framework needs to support it

our superhero comes in here: ** Reactive **

code will be
public Mono<User> getUser(@PathVariable String userId){
      return userService.getUser(userId)
                 .zipWith(userProfileService.getUserProfile(userId))
                 .map(tuple->{
                    User user = tuple.getT1();
                    user.setUserPreferences(tuple.getT2());
                    return user;
                 });
}
==> Code is simple. instead of doing manual
Few reusable flexible functions
Combine and reuse in powerful ways.

==>> Declarative code to build asynchronous processing pipelines.
  1.Different way of thinking about flow
  2.Different way of thinking about data
  3.Integrated with Java9 'Flow' interface.

<<<Learning curve.>>>

it is not needed for a simple projects. benefits will be more for when application grows.

Topics

Collection streams :
      Stream -- Represents a sequence of data, we focus on computation vs collections which focus on storage. Iterations are done internally.
      List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
      1.map
      2.filter
      3.flatMap
      4.findFirst
      5.findAny
check the Exercise1 for the samples for above.
In Streams each step will return the new Stream.
----------------------------------------
            Design Patterns
----------------------------------------
1. Iterator pattern  --  decouples the algorithms   Iterator ---> Consumer(asks the data for next)
                                                (data)
                    Container ---> IteratorImpl  --> Consumer

2. Observer pattern -- can be used when you want to Observe something goes on.
    Subject notifies to its subscribers when something happens.
                (Register)
      Source <------------------ Consumer
            (Data)
      Source -----> Observer
      (here source controls data, i have data you take)
When ?
 Iterator prints the elements in a collection.
 Observer, listen the mouse clicks and prints all.

Reactive Syntax

cliksChannel
        .filter(Objects::nonNUll)
        .subscribe(e->System.out.println(e));

Assembly line analogy is a Stream
True Assembly line. Comes over time.

-------------------
    Flow  Java--9
-------------------
Publisher
Subscriber
Subscription

All those are interfaces, no implementation on Java-9

What we are going to Use:   1. Flex 2.Mono

Flex -- supports asynchronous events 0 or n items
Mono -- supports asynchronous event 0 or 1 items

Mono-- emits the value we are done with it.

Reactive can do below o/p's
        1. An Item
        2. A complete event  (Terminal)
        3. A failure event   (Terminal)


subscribe();
subscribe(Consumer<? super T consumer>);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,Runnable completeConsumer);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,Runnable completeConsumer,
                                       Consumer<? super Subscription> subscriptionConsumer);
